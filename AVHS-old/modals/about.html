                        <p class="type-p5 text-gray-800">It is my honor to serve as the Principal of Antelope Valley High School. Antelope Valley High School (AVHS) has a rich history of successful students. AVHS first opened its doors in 1912, which makes it the oldest school in the district! In the beginning, due to the large geographic area covered by AVHS, students would ride busses to school on Monday, stay in dormitories, and returned home on Friday.</p>
                        <p class="type-p5 text-gray-800">For the first 75 years of its existence, AVHS dominated education and athletics in the Antelope Valley. The school is very proud to count State Senators, Members of the State Assembly, Journalists, Judges of the Superior Court, Professional Musicians, Athletes and Actors/Actresses as members of its long list of distinguished alumni. In short, countless AVHS graduates have gone on to make significant contributions to the local community and other communities worldwide.</p>
                        <p class="type-p5 text-gray-800">You will discover that your four years at AVHS will move very quickly with all that this beloved and distinguished institution has to offer. I challenge you to take advantage of the opportunities you are presented with here at AVHS; make the most of your classes and extra-curricular activities.</p>
                        <p class="type-p5 text-gray-800">The mission of AVHS is to provide a safe and secure learning environment that promotes a rigorous curriculum and enables our students to develop the necessary academic, technical, and work-related skills needed for success in the 21st century. This year we will focus on building positive relationships with students, providing students with the academic and social emotional skills and support they need to be successful, and building up our community outreach and involvement.</p>
                        <p class="type-p5 text-gray-800">Every class, club, activity, and sport we offer at AVHS has a core belief â€“ to engage, equip, and empower each of you to become a critical thinker and problem solver who is poised to positively impact our community, nation, and world. We ask you to commit to giving your best, each day, at Antelope Valley High School and you will be confident to master your future. We commit to you the ability to access all our programs and to provide you with a service-oriented school.</p>
                        <p class="type-p5 text-gray-800">I am excited to lead AVHS and to have the opportunity to work alongside our amazing staff, students, and parents to prepare every child for college or any career to which he/she aspires! This year will be an amazing year at Antelope Valley High School and I am proud to be part of its making.</p>
