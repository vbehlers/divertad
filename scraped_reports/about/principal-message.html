			<h2 class="fsElementTitle">Tardy Policy:</h2>
	</header>
	<div class="fsElementContent">
			<p>Highland High School recognizes its responsibility to ensure that students attend class regularly and on time, as attendance plays an important role in student achievement.</p>

<p>Tardiness is a failure to appear on time and is considered a form of absence. It is the student’s responsibility to be in the classroom and ready to work before the tardy bell rings. Such common problems as oversleeping and repeated occurrences of car trouble are unacceptable reasons for tardiness to school and are considered unexcused tardies/absences. Tardies are counted cumulatively and across classes.</p>

<p>Habitual tardiness is considered a form of truancy, and Education Code 48260 provides that legal action may be taken against a student and/or parent for truancy.</p>

<p>Failure to appear for a Saturday School will result in the assignment of one day In-House Suspension.</p>

<p>Disciplinary Procedure Philosophy - The Board of Education has the responsibility to see that an appropriate educational program is available to each student in our schools. Rules and regulations are established to ensure a proper climate in which students may pursue their studies. School personnel have been charged by the Board to carry out these rules in a friendly, firm and fair manner and to safeguard each student's right to the finest education we can provide. The Board further feels that good discipline is a shared responsibility. Students, parents, teachers, and administrators all share in this endeavor and responsibility. At any time, students may be disciplined and/or counseled by teachers, administrators or other staff members regarding their behavior and/or referred to other authorities in special circumstances.</p>

Good attendance, being at work on time and a reasonable dress standard will be expected by an employer. </b></p>

			<h3>Principal's Welcome to our KHS Hawks Students and Families</h3>

<p>It is with great pleasure that I am welcoming our KHS students to their 22-23 school year as their Principal. I am truly excited as I have a long, diverse history with KHS. I came to KHS from Littlerock High as a teacher when Knight's doors opened back in 2003-04 with its first freshman class. Since then I have grown administratively through KHS. In Knights' existence of 19 years, I've only been away 5 1/2 years. I wouldn't want to be any other place than here in Hawk territory representing all the great things the school, teachers, staff and students have to offer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we continue to work together through the struggles of coming out of the pandemic, Knight is committed to continue to provide the academic, behavioral and social emotional learning and support our students need to succeed. Our mission is to continue to re-engage our students in positive and healthy academic and social relationships with their school. In doing so we will focus our learning, teaching, interaction and participation in school events and life, around our Core Values of being Respectful, Responsible and Kind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We hope our students are looking forward to this year as much as we are!</p>

<p>Best wishes to all our students and families!</p>

<p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ms. Tammie Nickols</p>

			<p>It is my honor to serve as the Principal of Lancaster High School.

			<p>Welcome Royals and Families to the 2025–2026 School Year!</p>

<p>It’s an incredible honor to serve as your principal of Quartz Hill High School, especially as a proud QHHS alum. This isn’t just a new chapter in my career, it’s a return home. QHHS helped shape who I am, and now I have the opportunity to give back by helping today’s Royals reach even greater heights.</p>

<p>Although this is my first year leading Quartz Hill, I bring nearly a decade of principal experience and over twenty years of serving students and families throughout the Antelope Valley. I’m excited to bring that experience home to help students succeed in the classroom, in their activities, and in life after graduation.</p>

<p>At QHHS, academic excellence will always be our foundation. From AP and honors courses to dual enrollment, Academies, CTE pathways, and innovative electives, we’re focused on making sure every student has access to a meaningful, challenging, and relevant education. Whether you're passionate about STEM, the arts, world languages, leadership, athletics, or preparing for college and careers, we have opportunities waiting for you.</p>

<p>This is a campus where students are encouraged to dream big, set goals, and do the work it takes to reach them. Every Royal will be pushed to think critically, grow academically, and find their purpose.
