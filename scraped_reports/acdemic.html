<div class="nth-p">
<p>Advancement Via Individual Determination, AVID, is a seventh through twelfth grade program that prepares students in the academic middle for admission to a four-year college or university. Students take an AVID elective course throughout middle school and high school that provides them with the skills needed to be successful in advancing academically with the ultimate goal of attending college. For more than 25 years AVID has been instrumental in preparing students for success in higher education.</p>
</div>

<div class="p-group">
<p>The core component of the AVID Program is the AVID elective, which supports students as they challenge themselves in more rigorous classes. Students are taught study skills, note taking, time management, writing and research skills, while being immersed in a college-going culture. The class also includes tutoring sessions that are led by college students and provide support for success in the academically rigorous curriculum. Additionally, the AVID class provides access to information about colleges and universities through field trips, guest speakers, college tutors, scholarship opportunities and college admission requirement information.</p>

</div>

<div class="p-group">
<h3>Summer Reading Journal</h3>

<p>You will be required to write a minimum of 5 journal entries for each novel you read over summer break. These journals should be at least one page typed and double-spaced. Use a normal (Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri), 12-point font. Format and head your assignment (and all future assignments&nbsp;<a href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01">according to MLA rules.</a>)</p>
</div>

<div class="p-group">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h5>1.</h5>
</div>

<p>The first paragraph should be a SUMMARY of what you had read so far. Focus on key elements and details. Your summary should help others not familiar with the text "see it" or understand what it's about "in a nutshell." It should begin by mentioning which pages/chapters are covered by this journal entry, include a few sentences that explain key details or elements, and lead to your “judgment” or thesis claim about its main point or purpose.</p>
</div>

<div class="p-group">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<h5>2.</h5>
</div>

<p>Your ANALYSIS paragraph should begin with a sub-claim about how specific groups of details or elements support your thesis and overall main point. The basics of a good body paragraph: begin with your sub-claim, and then include examples and evidence that support your assertion. Introduce, explain, and then link the evidence to your claim.</p>
</div>

<div class="p-group">
<p>You should consider the following questions when looking for a focus:</p>

<p>What is the title?</p>

<p>Who is the narrator?</p>

<p>What voice does he/she speak in (i.e. 1<sup>st</sup> person, 3<sup>rd</sup> person). Why is he/she speaking?</p>

<p>How is the story/chapter/section organized? How does it begin or end?</p>

<p>Who are the characters and what are they like?</p>

<p>What is the tone like? What is the mood like?</p>

<p>What conflict or issue is explored? What happens? When? Where? To whom?</p>

<p>Do any images, words, phrases, etc. repeat themselves?</p>

<p>Is there any figurative language being used?</p>

<p>What world is being created? What values, ideas, and views are being represented? Which social groups are being represented? “Will all readers be equally at ease with the range of representations?”</p>
</div>

<div class="p-group">
<h5>Annotating the Text</h5>

<div class="p-group">
<h5 class="p-content">Critical Reading Strategies</h5>

<p>Pre-reading strategies:</p>

<p>Step 1: Prediction: Read the title and make a prediction about the contents of the text (Write the prediction next to the title).</p>

<p>Step 2: Number the paragraphs.</p>
</div>

<div class="p-group">
<h5>Read With the Grain</h5>

<h5 class="p-content">Reading to get the general idea of the text-not analyzing the information.</h5>

<h5>UC Prompts Personal Insight Questions:</h5>

<p>What do you want UC to know about you? Here’s your chance to tell us in your own words</p>

<p><span class="p-content">Directions:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>You will have 8 questions to choose from. You must respond to only 4 of the 8 questions.</li>
	<li>Each response is limited to a maximum of 350 words.</li>
	<li>Which questions you choose to answer is entirely up to you: But you should select questions that are most relevant to your experience and that best reflect your individual circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="p-content">Keep in mind</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>All questions are equal: All are given equal consideration in the application review process, which means there is no advantage or disadvantage to choosing certain questions over others.</li>
	<li>There is no right or wrong way to answer these questions: It’s about getting to know your personality, background, interests and achievements in your own unique voice.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Questions &amp; Guidance</h5>

<p>Remember, the personal questions are just that — personal. Which means you should use our guidance for each question just as a suggestion in case you need help. The important thing is expressing who are you, what matters to you and what you want to share with UC.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Describe an example of your leadership experience in which you have positively influenced others, helped resolve disputes, or contributed to group efforts over time.</p>

	<p><span class="p-content">Things to consider:</span> A leadership role can mean more than just a title. It can mean being a mentor to others, acting as the person in charge of a specific task, or taking lead role in organizing an event or project. Think about your accomplishments and what you learned from the experience. What were your responsibilities?</p>

	<p class="nth-p">Did you lead a team? How did your experience change your perspective on leading others? Did you help to resolve an important dispute at your school, church in your community or an organization? And your leadership role doesn’t necessarily have to be limited to school activities. For example, do you help out or take care of your family?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Every person has a creative side, and it can be expressed in many ways: problem solving, original and innovative thinking, and artistically, to name a few. Describe how you express your creative side.</p>

	<p><span class="p-content">Things to consider:</span> What does creativity mean to you? Do you have a creative skill that is important to you? What have you been able to do with that skill? If you used creativity to solve a problem, what was your solution? What are the steps you took to solve the problem?</p>

	<p class="nth-p">How does your creativity influence your decisions inside or outside the classroom? Does your creativity relate to your major or a future career?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>What would you say is your greatest talent or skill? How have you developed and demonstrated that talent over time?</p>

	<p><span class="p-content">Things to consider:</span> If there’s a talent or skill that you’re proud of, this is the time to share it. You don’t necessarily have to be recognized or have received awards for your talent (although if you did and you want to talk about, feel free to do so). Why is this talent or skill meaningful to you?</p>

	<p class="nth-p">Does the talent come naturally or have you worked hard to develop this skill or talent? Does your talent or skill allow you opportunities in or outside the classroom? If so, what are they and how do they fit into your schedule?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Describe how you have taken advantage of a significant educational opportunity or worked to overcome an educational barrier you have faced.</p>

	<p><span class="p-content">Things to consider:&nbsp;</span>An educational opportunity can be anything that has added value to your educational experience and better prepared you for college. For example, participation in an honors or academic enrichment program, or enrollment in an academy that’s geared toward an occupation or a major, or taking advanced courses that interest you — just to name a few.</p>

	<p class="nth-p">If you choose to write about educational barriers you’ve faced, how did you overcome or strive to overcome them? What personal characteristics or skills did you call on to overcome this challenge? How did overcoming this barrier help shape who are you today?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Describe the most significant challenge you have faced and the steps you have taken to overcome this challenge. How has this challenge affected your academic achievement?</p>

	<p><span class="p-content">Things to consider:</span>&nbsp;A challenge could be personal, or something you have faced in your community or school. Why was the challenge significant to you? This is a good opportunity to talk about any obstacles you’ve faced and what you’ve learned from the experience. Did you have support from someone else or did you handle it alone?</p>

	<p class="nth-p">If you’re currently working your way through a challenge, what are you doing now, and does that affect different aspects of your life? For example, ask yourself, “How has my life changed at home, at my school, with my friends, or with my family?”</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Describe your favorite academic subject and explain how it has influenced you.</p>

	<p>Things to consider: Discuss how your interest in the subject developed and describe any experience you have had inside and outside the classroom — such as volunteer work, summer programs, participation in student organizations and/or activities — and what you have gained from your involvement.</p>

	<p class="nth-p">Has your interest in the subject influenced you in choosing a major and/or career? Have you been able to pursue coursework at a higher level in this subject (honors, AP, IB, college or university work)?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>What have you done to make your school or your community a better place?</p>

	<p><span class="p-content">Things to consider:</span> Think of community as a term that can encompass a group, team or a place – like your high school, hometown, or home. You can define community as you see fit, just make sure you talk about your role in that community. Was there a problem that you wanted to fix in your community?</p>

	<p class="nth-p">Why were you inspired to act? What did you learn from your effort? How did your actions benefit others, the wider community or both? Did you work alone or with others to initiate change in your community?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>What is the one thing that you think sets you apart from other candidates applying to the University of California?</p>

	<p><span class="p-content">Things to consider:</span> Don’t be afraid to brag a little. Even if you don’t think you’re unique, you are — remember, there’s only one of you in the world. From your point of view, what do you feel makes you belong on one of UC’s campuses? When looking at your life, what does a stranger need to understand in order to know you?</p>

	<p class="nth-p">What have you not shared with us that will highlight a skill, talent, challenge, or opportunity that you think will help us know you better? We’re not necessarily looking for what makes you unique compared to others, but what makes you, YOU.</p>

	<p class="nth-p">If you are not applying to a UC (although, I am not sure why you wouldn’t), you will respond to the Common App Personal Insight Questions below:</p>

	<p class="nth-p">You are required to respond to ONE prompts (minimum/maximum 650 words).</p>
	</li>

<h3>AVHS Science Department</h3>

<p>Science is defined as: the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment.</p>

<p>In other words, science is a body of knowledge and a way to explain our the world around us. To help students understand the different methods scientists use to think and talk about the subject, every student at AVHS is encouraged to enroll in a science course each of their four years. It is encouraged for ambitious students to take more than the required two lab science courses required to graduate, and explore the many science options made available to AVHS students. We hope you find the discovery of science worthy of your time.</p>

<p>A typical pathway through high school science courses begins with the traditional sequence of biology, chemistry, and physics. You may branch out to the electives and AP courses as you become an upperclassman.</p>

<p>The University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) require entering freshmen to complete certain courses in high school. These courses are called the "a-g" courses because of the letter each subject area is assigned: "a" is for History/Social Science, "b" is for English, and so on. To receive "a-g" credit, a high school course must be certified through the UC course approval process.</p>

<p>Here is the list of "a-g", with the number of years required in each subject. UC recommends additional years in some areas as indicated.</p>

<p>a. <strong>History</strong> / <strong>Social Science</strong> (2 years)<br>
  b. <strong>English</strong> (4 years)<br>
  c. <strong>Mathematics</strong> (3 years, UC recommends 4)<br>
  d. <strong>Laboratory Science</strong> (2 years, UC recommends 3)<br>
  e. <strong>Language Other than English</strong> (2 years, UC recommends 3)<br>
  f. <strong>Visual</strong> / <strong>Performing Arts</strong> (1 year)<br>
  g. <strong>College Preparatory Elective</strong> (1 year)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Students that need a Letter of Recommendation should complete a Brag Sheet and give it to their Counselor or teacher at least a week before they need the letter.</p>

			<h1><strong>Departments, Academies, Pathways &amp; More</strong></h1>

<p>Welcome to the home of Palmdale High School Academic information. Here you will find information on everything from our dynamic academic departments and programs to course descriptions and graduation requirements.</p>

<h3>Social Science</h3>

<p>Palmdale High School's Social Studies Department is committed to developing students' understanding of our cultural interdependency and the significant connections between our present, past and future. Our courses challenge students to become knowledgeable and participatory citizens who value the traditions and freedoms of our democracy. We offer a sequential and disciplined approach to study skills that prepares students for the academic challenges of our college preparatory and advanced placement programs as well as those of a post secondary education.</p>

<h3>English</h3>

<p>The English Department of Palmdale High School offers an integrated program which seeks to demonstrate to students that all areas of study are interrelated and to foster an awareness of the necessity of communication and thinking skills in all aspects of life.</p>

<p>The course of studies in English is designed to foster a sequential development in reading, writing, speaking, and thinking skills. The program recognizes that student abilities and future goals vary. Therefore, classes are designed so that students will be challenged and that they will be able to achieve within their own capacities. The course of studies emphasizes a mixture of skills necessary for the college-bound but also provides course work needed by job-oriented students. All courses seek to encourage skills and mastery of the state standards, as they help to promote the development of the whole individual.</p>

<h3>Industrial Technology</h3>

<p>Our Industrial Technology Department includes several courses that offer students the opportunity to learn real-world skills. Many of these courses offer an internship at local work sites. Four career pathways lead students through their high school years towards a career as well as post-secondary education. Three of the pathways within the department are included in a California Partnership Academy named “F.A.S.T.”. The Falcon Academy of Sustainable Technologies is a state recognized program that leads students towards exciting careers and education related to emerging technologies.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.palmdalehs.org/academics/vapa" target="_blank">Visual and Performing Arts</a></h3>

<p>Palmdale High School's Visual and Performing Art Department continues a long-standing tradition of excellence in arts education in the Antelope Valley. Our high school art program is one of the finest in the district, offering students a variety of classes with varying levels of difficulty to further challenge our students. Some of the classes offered by our talented staff include drawing, painting, photography, ceramics, Drama, concert band, Orchestra, guitar, chorus, and visual communications. Our students excel in their artistic endeavors as they learn from a knowledgeable staff that teaches classes using the California State Standards for art.</p>

<p>The Palmdale High School Visual and Performing department consists of eleven teachers offering over 25 different classes within the arts. Our students are given the chance to show off their talent on campus, in the community, and throughout the state of California as they compete and perform in a number of events throughout the school year. Our students consistently receive state, national, and international honors as well as numerous scholarships.</p>

<p>We are proud of our extensive, challenging, high-quality programming in the visual and performing arts, and are always looking to add new and exciting classes to our already dynamic program.</p>

<h3>Mathematics</h3>

<p>The math department at Palmdale High is committed to providing all students with an exceptional learning program that will excel their future careers and academic activities. We offer courses ranging from Math Intervention to Advance Placement Calculus. Students are taught through the use of the latest technology and a wide variety of teaching methods in order to nurture a deep understanding of mathematical concepts. The school as a whole has given an extensive amount of resources to help the math department succeed in developing the desire in students to become life-long learners of math. Whether the student is preparing to enter a field which requires advance mathematics or a field that is not so inclined, the teachers in the math department are dedicated to helping every student succeed.</p>

<h3>Behavioral Science</h3>

<p>Healthful Living, a Behavioral Science, ninth grade, two semester, 10 unit course, is required for graduation.The curriculum is structured with primarily social issues covered in first semester and physical issues covered in second semester. Those issues generally encountered by our teenage population will be covered. Providing our students the knowledge to deal with many of the critical issues they may have to respond to during their high school years and beyond.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Science</h3>

<p>The Palmdale High School Agriculture Program is currently one of the largest in the region and boasts an enrollment of more than 500 students. The program consists of a variety of working areas including a farm laboratory, a working shop, 3 shade houses, a greenhouse, and vineyard. The Goal of the department is to incorporate science standards into an agriculture setting while still meeting the needs of our vocationally minded youth. This is being accomplished through the utilization and application of technology in our classrooms and laboratories, which leads to critical and higher order thinking skills.</p>

<h3>Foreign Language</h3>

<p>This world is no longer a place where one language meets the needs of society. Knowledge of a foreign language is necessary to communicate and link students’ understanding with the meaning of tolerance and acceptance of other people and culture. Foreign Language proficiency is becoming a necessity to succeed in our economically and politically interdependent world. Our Foreign Language Department is dedicated to ensure that our students here at Palmdale High School experience the learning of the foreign language in a meaningful way, so they are able to take their education’s practical value and enhance their academic achievements in any professional field of their choice.</p>

<h3>Special Education</h3>

<p>The goal of the Department of Special Education is to provide appropriate educational programs in the least restrictive environment for all students with disabilities. In providing educational services to students with disabilities, the PHS Special Education Department is responsive to the continually evolving nature of the field of special education, the requirements of federal and state legislation, court mandates, and the relationship between special and general education.</p>

<p>Further, it is believed that the goal of providing appropriate special educational services to students with disabilities can be achieved by working together with parents (i.e. natural/adoptive parents, legal guardians, and surrogate parents). It is our goal to continually work to improve and strengthen our special education programs and services is based upon the following principles:</p>

<p>Educational services are built on an appropriate evaluation that determines the level of support, related and/or instructional services required to meet the individual educational needs of students.</p>

<p>Educational services are provided in the least restrictive environment and to the maximum extent appropriate with non-disabled appropriate peers.</p>

<p>Educational services should emphasize the educational needs of the students.</p>
