        <p class="type-p5 font-normal paragraph">Highland High School recognizes its responsibility to ensure that students attend class regularly and on time, as attendance plays an important role in student achievement. Tardiness is a failure to appear on time and is considered a form of absence. It is the student’s responsibility to be in the classroom and ready to work before the tardy bell rings. Such common problems as oversleeping and repeated occurrences of car trouble are unacceptable reasons for tardiness to school and are considered unexcused tardies/absences.</p>
        <p class="type-p5 font-normal paragraph">Tardies are counted cumulatively and across classes. Habitual tardiness is considered a form of truancy, and Education Code 48260 provides that legal action may be taken against a student and/or parent for truancy. Failure to appear for a Saturday School will result in the assignment of one day In-House Suspension. Disciplinary Procedure Philosophy - The Board of Education has the responsibility to see that an appropriate educational program is available to each student in our schools. Rules and regulations are established to ensure a proper climate in which students may pursue their studies.</p>
        <p class="type-p5 font-normal paragraph">School personnel have been charged by the Board to carry out these rules in a friendly, firm and fair manner and to safeguard each student's right to the finest education we can provide. The Board further feels that good discipline is a shared responsibility. Students, parents, teachers, and administrators all share in this endeavor and responsibility. At any time, students may be disciplined and/or counseled by teachers, administrators or other staff members regarding their behavior and/or referred to other authorities in special circumstances.</p>

Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!” He took his vorpal sword in hand; Long time the manxome foe he sought— So rested he by the Tumtum tree And stood awhile in thought. And, as in uffish thought he stood, The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, And burbled as it came! One, two! One, two! And through and through The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!</p>
